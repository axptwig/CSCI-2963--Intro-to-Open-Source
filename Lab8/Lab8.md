My project for this semester is contributing to the swift algorithm club repository on Github. My plan is to implement self adjusting binary trees in swift, namely red-black trees and splay trees. Since the repository already has AVL trees implemented, i should have too many problems because the code for AVL rotations has already been submited by another contributer. Though i am extremly new to swift i am not having any trouble starting to implement my data structures. I have already created the structure of my class and and coded functions for the insertion of notes as well as a quick in order traversal routine. Next on the chopping block is adding AVL rotations and fixing up the tree for after an insertion and deletion.
