### Lab 1 Questions
        
C)       
	#2: Two things that could be added to Eric Raymondâ€™s article about how to ask questions the smart way are 1: you should first ask in your local network of friends or peers before taking to internet resources such as Stack Overflow. One of the benefits of this approach is that you can ascertain what the skills are of the people around you, and easily know where to go the next time you need help. 2: you could also use developer chat channels such as Slack used in RCOS and many software companies. If you have a well set up slack channel, you can ask your question to a specific set of people who can hopefully answer your question quickly.

G) So far this class has gone rather smoothly, I have solidified github basics by refreshing my self with the tutorial and practiced the fairly easy regex problems. I am excited for what's in store for the coming labs for intro to open source. One of the open source projectss that i am considering contributing to for my project is  called Progressbar.js. This project (hosted here: https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js) is a reactive progress bar which is animated using CSS SVG paths. There are plenty of issues so making a pull request should be fairly simple.
