2) It is important to choose a license for many reasons, but first of all it helps foster a sense of community. If you pick an open license such as the MIT license, it automatically tells anyone that is looking to pick up your code that they are able to do it without any legal implications. Another reason to choose a license is because licenses give you security as the owner of a product. If you are looking to keep parts of your application a secret, you can choose a license applicable to your situation, such as a copyleft license, and make sure that your industry secrets are indeed kept secret.

3) You shouldn't use a repository without a license because the absence of a license means that the content of that repository is “all rights reserved”. One can land him/herself into legal trouble for using unlicensed code so it is probably not worth the risk.
